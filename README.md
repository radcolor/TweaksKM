**Tweaks** is a simple [Linux](https://www.kernel.org) kernel manager app for Android™ devices running on Android L or newer. 
Designed beautifully with Material design.

## Working

App needs the Android's root permission to attain [privileged control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privilege_escalation) (known as [root access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superuser)) over various Android subsystems. As Android uses the Linux kernel, rooting an Android device gives similar access to administrative (superuser) permissions as on Linux or any other Unix-like operating system.
